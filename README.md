## Installation

To set up the project locally, it's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### 1. Create and activate virtual environment

**On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Testing

Run the test suite using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```

Make sure you're in the virtual environment when running tests.
