# Documentation Index

The `Doc/` directory is split into two groups:

- Tool specs: `Doc/Tools/`
- Reference materials: `Doc/Complexity/`, `Doc/DesignPatterns/`, `Doc/Python/`

## Reference Materials

- `Doc/Complexity/Complexity.md`: Intro to time and space complexity
- `Doc/DesignPatterns/README.md`: Design pattern categories and reading order
- `Doc/Python/OOP_Basics.md`: Python OOP basics
- `Doc/Python/OOP_Advanced.md`: Python OOP advanced topics

## Maintenance Notes

- Keep examples short and executable.
- Prefer consistent terms across files.
- Update this index if files are added or renamed.
